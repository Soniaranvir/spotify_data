# üéµ Spotify Playlist Analysis Project

## üìñ Project Overview

This project was created solely to understand and gain a deeper knowledge of advanced Python concepts, specifically working with APIs. The project involves analyzing a playlist of the top 50 songs fetched online using the Spotify API. The playlist data, including song details, album information, artist data, popularity, and track duration, is accessed by integrating Spotify's Web API through the Spotipy library. This project focuses on how to extract, process, and analyze data from a real-world service, such as Spotify, to uncover trends and insights.

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand Song Popularity: Identify the most popular songs within the top 50 playlist and determine what makes them stand out.
- Explore Artist Trends: Analyze the most frequent artists in the playlist and their impact on song popularity.
- Analyze Song Durations: Investigate the relationship between song length and its popularity or other features.
- Learn Spotify API: Understand how to interact with the Spotify API to fetch data for analysis and integrate it into Python.

## üîë Features & Key Functionalities:
- Data Extraction from Spotify API: Using the Spotipy library, the project fetches data from Spotify's top 50 playlist, which includes song name, artist, album, track duration, popularity, and more.
- Data Analysis: Data is processed and analyzed using Pandas to understand patterns such as song length, artist, popularity, and album genre.

## üîç Key Insights
- Most Popular Song: The song with the highest popularity rating is identified, along with factors influencing its success.
- Artist Frequency: The project highlights which artists dominate the playlist and their influence on the overall tracklist.
- Song Duration Trends: A closer look at the distribution of song lengths and their relationship to popularity.
- Album Insights: Exploring how different albums fare within the top 50 playlist and any patterns related to album release year or genre.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset fetched from the Spotify API includes the following columns:

- Song Name: Name of the song.
- Artist: The artist(s) associated with the song.
- Album: The album from which the song is taken.
- Duration: Length of the song in milliseconds.
- Popularity: Popularity score of the song (range from 0 to 100).
- Track ID: Unique identifier for the track.
- Album Type: Type of album (e.g., album, single).
- Genre: The genre of the song or album.

## üíª Code Overview
The code uses the Spotipy library to fetch data from Spotify's API and pandas for data manipulation. 
- The project is built in a Jupyter notebook environment for easy exploration and analysis.

## üìù Steps:
- API Integration: Set up the Spotipy library to access Spotify‚Äôs Web API and fetch data for the top 50 songs.
- Data Extraction: Pull song details, including name, artist, album, and popularity.
- Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and handle missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore song popularity, album types, artist trends, and song duration distribution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques
- Python: Used for data extraction, analysis, and manipulation.
- Spotipy: A Python library to interact with the Spotify Web API for fetching song data.
- Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis (loading, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset).
- Jupyter Notebooks: IDE used for executing the code interactively.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Users:
A Spotify Developer Account must be created to access the API. After creating an account, you will need to generate a Client ID and Client Secret ID from the Spotify Dashboard.
These credentials should be added to the code to authenticate and access the Spotify API. Ensure that you replace the placeholders for CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in the script with your own credentials before running the code.

## üöÄ Project Significance

This project is an excellent exercise for learning how to interact with APIs, specifically Spotify's API, and diving into advanced Python concepts such as data extraction, processing, and analysis. It helps in understanding how data from real-world services can be used to extract meaningful insights and trends. Additionally, it serves as an introduction to integrating APIs with Python and applying data analysis techniques to music and entertainment data.
